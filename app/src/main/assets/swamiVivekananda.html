        <h1>Swami Vivekananda</h1>
        <HR COLOR="yellow" WIDTH="100%">
        <p>Swami Vivekananda, known in his pre-monastic life as <b>Narendranath Datta</b>, was born in an
            affluent family in <b>Kolkata on 12 January 1863</b>. His father, <b>Vishwanath Datta</b>,
            was a successful attorney with interests in a wide range of subjects, and his mother,
            <b>Bhuvaneshwari Devi</b>, was endowed with deep devotion, strong character and other
            qualities. A precocious boy, Narendra excelled in music, gymnastics and studies. By the
            time he graduated from Calcutta University, he had acquired a vast knowledge of different
            subjects, especially Western philosophy and history. Born with a yogic temperament, he
            used to practise meditation even from his boyhood, and was associated with Brahmo
            Movement for some time.</p>

        <p><b>With Sri Ramakrishna</b><br>At the threshold of youth Narendra had to pass through a
            period of spiritual crisis when he was assailed by doubts about the existence of God.
            It was at that time he first heard about <b>Sri Ramakrishna</b> from one of his English
            professors at college. One day in November 1881, Narendra went to meet Sri Ramakrishna
            who was staying at the Kali Temple in <b>Dakshineshwar</b>. He straightaway asked the
            Master a question which he had put to several others but had received no satisfactory
            answer: “Sir, have you seen God?” Without a moment’s hesitation, Sri Ramakrishna replied:
            “Yes, I have. I see Him as clearly as I see you, only in a much intenser sense.” <br>
            Apart from removing doubts from the mind of Narendra, Sri Ramakrishna won him over
            through his pure, unselfish love. Thus began a guru-disciple relationship which is
            quite unique in the history of spiritual masters. Narendra now became a frequent
            visitor to Dakshineshwar and, under the guidance of the Master, made rapid strides on
            the spiritual path. At Dakshineshwar, Narendra also met several young men who were
            devoted to Sri Ramakrishna, and they all became close friends.</p>
        <p><b>Difficult Situations</b><br>After a few years two events took place which caused
            Narendra considerable distress. One was the sudden death of his father in 1884. This
            left the family penniless, and Narendra had to bear the burden of supporting his mother,
            brothers and sisters. The second event was the illness of Sri Ramakrishna which was
            diagnosed to be cancer of the throat. In September 1885 Sri Ramakrishna was moved to a
            house at <b>Shyampukur</b>, and a few months later to a rented villa at <b>Cossipore</b>.
            In these two places the young disciples nursed the Master with devoted care. In spite
            of poverty at home and inability to find a job for himself, Narendra joined the group
            as its leader.</p>

        </div>
        <p><b>Beginnings of a Monastic Brotherhood</b><br>Sri Ramakrishna instilled in these young
            men the spirit of renunciation and brotherly love for one another. One day he distributed
            ochre robes among them and sent them out to beg food. In this way he himself laid the
            foundation for a new monastic order. He gave specific instructions to Narendra about
            the formation of the new monastic Order. In the small hours of 16 August 1886 Sri
            Ramakrishna gave up his mortal body. After the Master’s passing, fifteen of his young
            disciples (one more joined them later) began to live together in a dilapidated building
            at <b>Baranagar</b> in North Kolkata. Under the leadership of Narendra, they formed a
            new monastic brotherhood, and in 1887 they took the formal vows of sannyasa, thereby
            assuming new names. Narendra now became Swami Vivekananda (although this name was
            actually assumed much later.)</p>
        <p><b>Awareness of Life’s Mission</b><br>After establishing the new monastic order,
            Vivekananda heard the inner call for a greater mission in his life. While most of the
            followers of Sri Ramakrishna thought of him in relation to their own personal lives,
            Vivekananda thought of the Master in relation to India and the rest of the world. As the
            prophet of the present age, what was Sri Ramakrishna’s message to the modern world and
            to India in particular? This question and the awareness of his own inherent powers urged
            Swamiji to go out alone into the wide world. So in the middle of 1890, after receiving
            the blessings of Sri Sarada Devi, the divine consort of Sri Ramakrishna, known to the
            world as Holy Mother, who was then staying in Kolkata, Swamiji left Baranagar Math and
            embarked on a long journey of exploration and discovery of India.</p>

        <p><b>Discovery of Real India</b><br>During his travels all over India, Swami Vivekananda
            was deeply moved to see the appalling poverty and backwardness of the masses. He was
            the first religious leader in India to understand and openly declare that the real cause
            of India’s downfall was the neglect of the masses. The immediate need was to provide
            food and other bare necessities of life to the hungry millions. For this they should be
            taught improved methods of agriculture, village industries, etc. It was in this context
            that Vivekananda grasped the crux of the problem of poverty in India (which had escaped
            the attention of social reformers of his days): owing to centuries of oppression, the
            downtrodden masses had lost faith in their capacity to improve their lot. It was first
            of all necessary to infuse into their minds faith in themselves. For this they needed a
            life-giving, inspiring message. Swamiji found this message in the principle of the Atman,
            the doctrine of the potential divinity of the soul, taught in Vedanta, the ancient system
            of religious philosophy of India. He saw that, in spite of poverty, the masses clung to
            religion, but they had never been taught the life-giving, ennobling principles of Vedanta
            and how to apply them in practical life.</p>
        <div align="center">
        <img src="./swamiji10.jpg" alt="swamiji" align="middle">
        </div>
        <p>Thus the masses needed two kinds of knowledge: secular knowledge to improve their
            economic condition, and spiritual knowledge to infuse in them faith in themselves and
            strengthen their moral sense. The next question was, how to spread these two kinds of
            knowledge among the masses? Through education – this was the answer that Swamiji found.</p>
        <p><b>Need for an Organization</b><br>One thing became clear to Swamiji: to carry out his
            plans for the spread of education and for the uplift of the poor masses, and also of
            women, an efficient organization of dedicated people was needed. As he said later on,
            he wanted “to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep
            of even the poorest and the meanest.” It was to serve as this ‘machinery’ that Swamiji
            founded the <b>Ramakrishna Mission</b> a few years later. </p>
        <p><b>Decision to attend the Parliament of Religions</b><br>It was when these ideas were
            taking shape in his mind in the course of his wanderings that Swami Vivekananda heard
            about the World’s Parliament of Religions to be held in Chicago in 1893. His friends and
            admirers in India wanted him to attend the Parliament. He too felt that the Parliament
            would provide the right forum to present his Master’s message to the world, and so he
            decided to go to America. Another reason which prompted Swamiji to go to America was to
            seek financial help for his project of uplifting the masses.</p>
        <div align="center">
        <img src="./swamiji4.jpg" alt="swamiji1" align="middle">
        </div>
        <p>Swamiji, however, wanted to have an inner certitude and divine call regarding his mission.
            Both of these he got while he sat in deep meditation on the rock-island at Kanyakumari.
            With the funds partly collected by his Chennai disciples and partly provided by the
            Raja of Khetri, Swami Vivekananda left for America from Mumbai on 31 May 1893.</p>
        <p><b>The Parliament of Religions and After</b><br>His speeches at the World’s Parliament of
            Religions held in September 1893 made him famous as an ‘orator by divine right’ and as a
            ‘Messenger of Indian wisdom to the Western world’. After the Parliament, Swamiji spent
            nearly three and a half years spreading Vedanta as lived and taught by Sri Ramakrishna,
            mostly in the eastern parts of USA and also in London.</p>

        </div>
        <p><b>Awakening His Countrymen</b><br>He returned to India in January 1897. In response to
            the enthusiastic welcome that he received everywhere, he delivered a series of lectures
            in different parts of India, which created a great stir all over the country.
            Through these inspiring and profoundly significant lectures Swamiji attempted to do
            the following:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. to rouse the religious consciousness of
            the people and create in them pride in their cultural heritage;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            2. to bring about unification of Hinduism by pointing out the common bases of its sects;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. to focus the attention of educated people on the plight of
            the downtrodden masses, and to expound his plan for their uplift by the application of
            the principles of Practical Vedanta.</p>
        <p><b>Founding of Ramakrishna Mission</b><br>Soon after his return to Kolkata, Swami
            Vivekananda accomplished another important task of his mission on earth. He founded on
            <b>1 May 1897</b> a unique type of organization known as Ramakrishna Mission, in which
            monks and lay people would jointly undertake propagation of Practical Vedanta, and
            various forms of social service, such as running hospitals, schools, colleges, hostels,
            rural development centres etc, and conducting massive relief and rehabilitation work for
            victims of earthquakes, cyclones and other calamities, in different parts of India and
            other countries.</p>
        <p><b>Belur Math</b><br>In early 1898 Swami Vivekananda acquired a big plot of land on the
            western bank of the Ganga at a place called Belur to have a permanent abode for the
            monastery and monastic Order originally started at Baranagar, and got it registered as
            Ramakrishna Math after a couple of years. Here Swamiji established a new, universal
            pattern of monastic life which adapts ancient monastic ideals to the conditions of
            modern life, which gives equal importance to personal illumination and social service,
            and which is open to all men without any distinction of religion, race or caste. </p>
        <p><b>Disciples</b><br>It may be mentioned here that in the West many people were influenced
            by Swami Vivekananda’s life and message. Some of them became his disciples or devoted
            friends. Among them the names of <b>Margaret Noble</b> (later known as <b>Sister Nivedita</b>)
            , <b>Captain and Mrs Sevier, Josephine McLeod</b> and <b>Sara Ole Bull</b>, deserve special mention.
            Nivedita dedicated her life to educating girls in Kolkata. Swamiji had many Indian
            disciples also, some of whom joined Ramakrishna Math and became sannyasins.</p>
        <p><b>Last Days</b><br>In June 1899 he went to the West on a second visit. This time he spent
            most of his time in the West coast of USA. After delivering many lectures there, he
            returned to Belur Math in December 1900. The rest of his life was spent in India,
            inspiring and guiding people, both monastic and lay. Incessant work, especially giving l
            ectures and inspiring people, told upon Swamiji’s health. His health deteriorated and
            the end came quietly on the night of <b>4 July 1902</b>. Before his Mahasamadhi he had
            written to a Western follower: “It may be that I shall find it good to get outside my
            body, to cast it off like a worn out garment. But I shall not cease to work. I shall
            inspire men everywhere until the whole world shall know that it is one with God.” </p>
