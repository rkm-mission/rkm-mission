    <p>The Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission provide opportunities for the public to
        cooperate with the twin organizations in carrying out various types of work chalked out by
        Swami Vivekananda for serving humanity. This cooperation may consist in active participation
        in the activities of the Mission, or in the contribution to the different Funds of the Math
        and the Mission. Admirers and devotees, who are in sympathy with the objects of the twin
        organizations but are unable to take part in our activities, are cordially invited to help
        us by contributing to one or more of the Funds, which need their active support. Donations
        to the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission are exempt from income tax under Section
        80G of the IT Act, 1961 (Applicable only to Indian donors).</p>
    <p><b>Donors can contribute either to the Ramakrishna Math or the Ramakrishna Mission at a time.
        However, online donations can be made for multiple purposes to the Math or the Mission.</b></p>
