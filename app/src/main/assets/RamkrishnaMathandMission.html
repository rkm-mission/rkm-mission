        <b>Ramakrishna Math and Mission - What they are?</b>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ramakrishna Math</b> and <b>Ramakrishna Mission</b> are worldwide, non-political, non-sectarian
            spiritual organizations which have been engaged in various forms of humanitarian, social
            service activities for more than a century.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspired by the ideals of renunciation and service, the monks and lay
            devotees of the Math and Mission serve millions of men, women and children, without
            any distinction of caste, religion or race, because they see the living God in them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The organizations were brought into existence by Sri Ramakrishna (1836-1886),
            the great 19th century saint from Bengal who is regarded as the Prophet of the Modern
            Age, and Sri Ramakrishna's chief disciple, Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902), one of the
            foremost thinkers and religious leaders of the present age, who is regarded as 'one of
            the main moulders of the modern world', in the words of an eminent Western scholar A.L.
            Basham.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission are legally and financially
            separate, they are closely inter-related in several ways and are regarded as twin
            organizations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>These twin organizations have set in motion a non-sectarian, universal
            spiritual movement which has been silently working for more than a hundred years to
            catalyze the spiritual regeneration of humanity.</b></p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief catalyst in this ongoing transformation is India's ancient religious
            philosophy known as Vedanta. Although several other systems of philosophy arose in India
            at different times, they were confined to small groups. Vedanta alone has remained the 
            dominant philosophy of India's religious tradition from Vedic times to the present day. 
            In modern times this ancient system of thought has been purified, unified and energized 
            by Sri Ramakrishna, and expounded in the modern idiom by Swami Vivekananda and thus made
            available to all people all over the world without any distinctions of caste, creed or 
            race.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ramakrishna Order does not believe in conversion, nor does it indulge in
            the occult or the sensational. The Order places utmost importance on personal spiritual
            unfoldment and selfless service. Inspired by the idea of the harmony of all faiths, its
            centers encourage adherents of different faiths to meet in a spirit of friendship and
            mutual appreciation, and to learn from one another without having to give up one's own
            faith. In the words of Sri Ramakrishna: "God has made different religions to suit
            different aspirants, lives and countries ... all doctrines are only so many paths; but
            a path is by no means God Himself. Indeed one can reach God if one follows any of the
            paths with whole-hearted devotion."</p>
        <p><b>Motto:</b> The motto of the twin organizations is Atmano mokshartham jagad hitaya cha, “For
            one’s own salvation and for the welfare of the world”.  It was formulated by Swami
            Vivekananda.</p>
        <p><b>Ideals:</b> Work as worship, potential divinity of the soul, and harmony of religions
            are three of the noteworthy ideals on which these two organizations are based.  It is
            this ideal of service to man as service to God that sustains the large number of
            hospitals, dispensaries, mobile medical units, schools, colleges, rural development
            centres and many other social service institutions run the twin organizations. </p>
        <p><b>Headquarters:</b> The headquarters of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission are
            situated at an area named Belur in the district of Howrah, West Bengal, India.  The
            entire campus of the headquarters is popularly known as ‘Belur Math’.  Sprawling over
            forty acres of land on the western bank of the river Hooghly (Ganga), the place is an
            hour’s drive from Kolkata.</p>

        <p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"><b>Branch Centres:</b> The Math and Mission have 171
            centres all over the world: 128 in
            India, 13 in USA, 12 in Bangladesh, 2 in Russia, and one each in Argentina, Australia,
            Brazil, Canada, Fiji, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Mauritius, Netherlands,
            Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, and UK.  Besides, there are 33
            sub-centres attached to some of these centres.</p>
        <p>Besides these branch centres, there are about one thousand unaffiliated centres
            (popularly called ‘private centres’) all over the world started by the devotees and
            followers of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda.</p>
