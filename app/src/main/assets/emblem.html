        <p>The emblem of the Ramkrishna Order designed by Swamiji is a unique and unparalleled work
            of art created by one of the richest minds in contemporary history in an exalted mood of
            spiritual inspiration. It is a profound symbol of harmony and synthesis for reverential
            meditation in this present age of conflict and disharmony. This symbol is the epitome of
            Swamiji's message of harmony and synthesis, leading to life's fulfilment. This is indeed
            the most eloquent expression of what he really preached, what he wanted every man and
            woman to be, to realize, either in the East or in the West. The goal is to realize, even
            in this very life, one's real Self, the self-effulgent Atman, the Swan in the emblem and
            through this realization to be free of all limitations, all bondages, all littleness.
            This spiritual freedom is one thing to be aspired for and achieved in this very life.
            It releases one from one's prison-house of limited individuality and confers upon him
            or her, the blessing of universal existence. He then becomes one with
            Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. 'Be free. This is the whole of religion'
            said Swamiji. The meaning behind this emblem, in the language of Vivekananda himself :
            <br><font color="red">"The wavy waters in the picture are symbolic of Karma, the lotus
                of Bhakti, and the rising-sun of Jnana. The encircling serpent is indicative of Yoga
                and awakened Kundalini Shakti, while the swan in the picture stands for Paramatman.
                Therefore, the ideal of the picture is that by the union of Karma, Jnana, Bhakti and
                Yoga, the vision of the Paramatman is obtained"</font></p>
