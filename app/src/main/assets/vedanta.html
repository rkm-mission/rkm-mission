        <h1><b>Vedanta and Indian Culture</b></h1>

          <h2>Spirituality : The Life-centre of Indian Culture</h2>
            <p>Indian civilization is more than five thousand years old.
                During this long period it produced a unique type of highly advanced and variegated
                culture. In spite of the innumerable regional, social and linguistic diversities of
                the country, there has always been a basic unity in Indian culture.  Moreover, this
                culture maintained unbroken continuity from Vedic times to the present day, in spite
                of countless wars within the country, invasions from outside and two centuries of
                subjugation by the British.  This indestructible unity and unbroken continuity of
                Indian culture are derived from its deep spiritual foundations. Swami Vivekananda
                has pointed out that every civilization or culture has a particular life-centre, a
                dominant characteristic or trend.  According to him the life-centre of Indian
                culture is spirituality.  By spirituality is meant a way of life oriented to the
                ultimate purpose or goal of life which is the realization of the Supreme Spirit or
                God.<br></p>

          <b>Unity of Philosophy and Religion in India</b>
            <p>Indian spirituality is deeply rooted in the ancient philosophical and religious
                traditions of the land.  Philosophy arose in India as an enquiry into the mystery
                of life and existence.  A parallel situation arose in ancient Greece also.  But, as
                Swami Vivekananda pointed out, the Greek philosophers confined their enquiries to
                the external world, and the method they employed was only speculation, whereas in
                India philosophical enquiries were carried out in the inner world.  Indian sages,
                called Rishis or ‘seers’, developed special techniques of transcending the senses
                and the ordinary mind, collectively called Yoga.  With the help of these techniques
                they delved deep into the depths of consciousness and discovered important truths
                about the true nature of man and the universe.</p>
            <p>The sages found that man’s true nature is not the body or the mind, which are ever
                changing and perishable, but the spirit which is unchanging, immortal, pure
                consciousness.  They called it the Atman.  The Atman is man’s true Self, the true
                knower, the true source of man’s knowledge, happiness and power.  The Rishis further
                found that all individual selves are parts of infinite Consciousness which they
                called Brahman.  Brahman is the ultimate Reality, the ultimate cause of the
                universe.  Ignorance of man’s true nature is the main cause of human suffering and
                bondage.  By gaining correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman it is possible to
                become free from suffering and bondage and attain a state of immortality,
                everlasting peace and fulfilment known as <b>Mukti</b>.</p>
            <p>Religion in ancient India meant a way of life which enabled man to realize his true
                nature and attain <b>Mukti</b>.</p>
            <p>Thus philosophy provided a correct view of Reality, while religion showed the correct
                way of life; philosophy provided the vision, while religion brought about the
                fulfilment; philosophy was the theory, and religion was the practice.  Thus in
                ancient India, philosophy and religion complemented each other.  In fact, they
                together constituted a single endeavour, an integral discipline.<b>This integral
                    religious philosophy or philosophical religion was called Vedanta</b>.The term
                Vedanta comes from the fact that its basic principles constitute the last part or
                culmination of the ancient scriptures known as the Vedas.<br></p>

          <b>The Vedas</b>
            <p>The Vedas are the oldest and most authoritative scriptures of Hinduism.  All other
                scriptures are subordinate to them.  They were not composed by anybody but were
                ‘revealed’ to the Rishis; hence they are also called ‘Shruti’, ‘that which is
                heard’.  The earlier part of the Vedas may have been composed between 2000 B.C. and
                1000 B.C.  There are four Vedas: Rig-veda, Yajur-veda, Sama-veda and Atharva-veda.
            <b>Each of these has four divisions: Samhita, Brahmana, Aranyaka and Upanishads</b>.</p>
            <p><span class="tab"><b>Samhita : </b>This section is a collection of hymns addressed to
                various deities.  Many of these hymns have deep mystical significance.<br>
            <b>Brahmana : </b>This portion deals with various rituals and also with moral principles.
            <br><b>Aranyaka : </b>This portion contains various meditations.  Some of these meditations
                are mental recreations of external rituals.<br><b>Upanishads : </b>These are the records
                of the transcendental experiences gained by Rishis by following different
                contemplative techniques.  These experiences are actually revelations about Atman,
                Brahman and other eternal, universal truths regarding the ultimate Reality.<br></span></p>
            <p>These eternal truths and principles of the spiritual world, lying scattered in the
                Upanishads, were brought together and codified by Badarayana in the form of sutras
                or aphorisms in the 5th century B.C. <b>These sutras known as Brahma Sutras form the
                    foundation of the system of philosophy known as Vedanta-Darshana.</b><br></p>

          <b>Vedanta</b>
            <p>Thus the term Vedanta stands for three inter-related things:<br><b>(a) the Upanishads
                collectively, which form the last and the most important part of the Vedas.</b><br>
            <b>(b) the eternal truths and principles of the spiritual realm.</b><br><b>(c) the
                    system of philosophy based on Brahma Sutras.</b><br>However, it is mostly in
                the last sense of Vedanta Darshana (Vedanta Philosophy) that the term Vedanta is
                commonly used.<br>In this connection it should be pointed out that five more systems
                of philosophy arose in India in the early centuries of the Christian era.
                These are:<br><b>1)     Mimamsa, founded by Jaimini</b><br><b>2)     Vaisheshika,
                    founded by Kanada</b><br><b>3)     Nyaya, founded by Gautama</b><br>
            <b>4)     Sankhya, founded by Kapila</b><br><b>5)     Yoga, founded by Patanjali</b><br>
                These five systems of philosophy always remained confined to small groups of
                intellectuals.  They never became identified with the mainstream religion of the
                land and, in due course, they ceased to be in vogue.  Vedanta alone remained the
                main philosophy of India from the Vedic period, and Vedanta alone got identified
                with the religion of the land.  As already mentioned, Vedanta is both philosophy
                and religion.  This combined religious and philosophical tradition of India came
                to be called <b>Sanatana Dharma, “Eternal Religion”</b> and, still later, as Hinduism.<br></p>

          <b>Other scriptures of Vedanta</b>
            <p>Although the Upanishads constitute the original and most authoritative source of
                Vedanta, they are not the only scripture of Vedanta.  Several other books also came
                to be accepted as authoritative.  Among these, the most important one is Bhagavad
                Gita.  It introduced several new concepts into Vedanta such as God incarnating
                Himself as the Avatar age after age, devotion to personal God as means to Mukti,
                discharging one’s duties of life in a spirit of selflessness and self-surrender to
                God as a spiritual path, and so on.  Over the centuries great teachers like
                Shankara, Ramanuja, and great saints of medieval period enriched Vedanta with
                philosophical concepts and devotional songs.</p>
            <p><b>Three Phases of Vedanta</b><br>Vedanta is not a static philosophy or religion.
                It is a highly dynamic, ever-growing philosophy and religion capable of meeting
                challenges and overcoming obstacles.  In this process of growth, Vedanta has passed
                through three phases.<br><b>(i) Formative Phase: </b>This phase extended from around
                1000 B.C. to 3rd century B.C.  During this period the Upanishads, the Gita and the
                Brahma-sutras (these three scriptures are together called Prasthana-traya) provided
                the basic concepts of Vedanta such as Atman and Brahman.<br><b>(ii) Scholastic Phase: </b>
                This phase extended from about the 8th century A.D. to the 13th century.  During
                this period great teachers like Shankara expounded and expanded the original
                intuitive insights of Vedic Rishis and the teachings of the Gita, and established
                Vedanta as a cogent, comprehensive system of philosophy – the most cogent and
                comprehensive religious philosophy the world has ever seen.
                But during this period Vedanta split into a number of philosophical schools and
                religious sects. The main philosophical schools were the following:<br>Advaita or
                Non-dualism propounded by Shankara<br>Vishishta-advaita propounded by Ramanuja<br>
                Dvaita propounded by Madhva<br>Shuddhadvaita propounded by Vallabha<br>
                Achintya-bheda-abheda propounded by Jiva Gosvamin<br>These schools of philosophy
                carried on acrimonious debates among themselves which kept up the intellectual
                vigour of the people.  India produced during this period many great scholars and
                thinkers.<br>The main religious sects were:  <b>Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism</b>.
                Each of these had several sub-sects.  These sects produced many saints.  These
                saints spread Vedantic ideas among the common people through songs and teachings.<br>
                Here mention should be made of two other religio-philosophical traditions associated
                with Indian culture, namely Buddhism and Jainism.  They arose as spiritual movements
                in the 6th century BC.  They shared some of the basic concepts of India’s ancient
                belief system such as Karma, rebirth, samsara, Dharma and direct spiritual experience.
                But their rejection of the authority of the Veda, caste distinction, belief in an
                Ultimate Reality as the Supreme Deity and ultimate cause of the universe, and other
                principles alienated them from the main stream of Vedantic culture.  As a result,
                Buddhism and Jainism began to decline in India and, after the 12th century AD,
                Buddhism ceased to have any direct influence on the development of Indian culture.<br>
            <b>(iii)  Modern Phase : </b>The third phase of Vedanta was inaugurated by Sri
                Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda in the 19th century.  During this period Vedanta
                was transformed from an ethnic religious philosophy into a universal philosophy of life.<br></p>
          <b>The main transformations brought about by
              <a href="file:///android_asset/sriRamkrishna.html">Sri Ramakrishna</a> and
              <a href="file:///android_asset/swamiVivekananda.html">Swami Vivekananda</a> are given below:<br></b>

            <p><b>1. Rejuvenation : </b>Sri Ramakrishna is the real link between ancient India and
                modern India.  Through stupendous spiritual efforts Sri Ramakrishna relived the
                entire range of spiritual experiences of the sages and saints of the past from
                Vedic times to his times.  He thereby revalidated the truths of Vedanta.  He
                traversed the paths of Vedic, Shaiva, Shakta and Vaishnava traditions, including
                obscure and forgotten paths.  He brought about the purification of spiritual life
                by emphasizing its moral foundation, and rejecting occultism, esoterism and
                miracle-mongering.  He made God realization possible for all even in the midst of
                the distractions of the modern world.  He imparted tremendous fervour to the efforts
                to realize God.  All this has resulted in a thorough rejuvenation of Vedanta in
                modern times.</p>
            <p><b>2. Modernization : </b>Swami Vivekananda’s great work was to make ancient Vedantic
                concepts acceptable to modern minds by interpreting the eternal truths in the light
                of modern rational thought and science.  This modernized version is what most of the
                present-day educated Hindus understand by Vedanta. </p>
            <p><b>3. Integration of Philosophical Schools : </b>Vedanta had split into different
                schools in the Middle Ages.  Swami Vivekananda brought about the reintegration of
                these schools. He did this by stressing the common ground of different schools,
                especially the principle of Atman, and by showing that the different schools
                represent different stages of realization of the ultimate Reality.</p>
            <p><b>4. Unification of Religious Sects : </b>Sri Ramakrishna taught, from his
                realization, that all spiritual paths lead to the same ultimate goal, Yato mat
                tato path. “As many views, so many paths to God”.  This principle, which forms the
                basis of his doctrine of dharma-samanvaya or Harmony of Religions, came to be
                applied within Hinduism itself in due course.  This has given rise to a sense of
                unity among Hindu sects in modern times, in spite of many differences in customs and
                traditions.</p>
            <p><b>5. Meeting of Challenges : </b>Till the eleventh century A.D. the only challenges
                Vedanta had to face were internal; these came mainly from Buddhism and Jainism and
                from dissensions of different schools of Vedanta and sects of Hinduism each of which
                claimed superiority over the others.   From the thirteenth century Islam began to
                exert its influence on Indian society in a big way.  Many great saints then arose in
                different parts of India and responded to the Islamic challenge by spreading the
                ideas of oneness of God, brotherhood of man and social equality among the common
                people.<br>However, the greatest challenge Indian society ever faced came from
                Western culture in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  Western culture posed
                three major challenges to Indian society:<br>(a) modern rational thought and science<br>
                (b) an open society which values freedom and social justice<br>(c) the idea of a
                saviour God who identifies himself with the poor, the sick and the fallen.<br>Sri
                Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda met these Western challenges:<br>(a) by
                revitalizing Vedantic spirituality,<br>(b) by interpreting the eternal truths of
                Vedanta, discovered by the ancient sages, in the light of modern rational thought,
                and<br>(c) by introducing a new gospel of social service based on the practical
                application of Vedantic principles in day-to-day life.<br></p>
            <p><b>6. Practical Vedanta : </b>By “Practical Vedanta” is meant the practical
                application of the basic principles of Vedanta in solving the problems of day-to-day
                life.  For centuries Vedantic principles were intended only to help people to
                attain Mukti or liberation.  Swami Vivekananda, however, showed that the highest p
                rinciples of Vedanta can be applied even in ordinary life to solve the day-to-day
                problems of life.  Vedantic principles can be applied not only in individual life
                but also in social life.  In fact, Swamiji held that India’s downfall took place
                mainly because the eternal spiritual principles were not applied in collective life.</p>
            <p><b>7. Universalization of Vedanta : </b>For many centuries the essential, basic
                truths of Vedanta remained bound up with innumerable beliefs, myths, customs,
                castes, etc.  Moreover, the higher truths of Vedanta were available only to a small
                group of privileged people, and it was believed that to follow the principles of
                Vedanta one had to be born in a certain Hindu caste.  Sri Ramakrishna and Swami
                Vivekananda separated the essential truths of Vedanta from the non-essentials.
                Swamiji showed that the essential truths of Vedanta constitute the eternal,
                universal truths of the spiritual world which form the rationale and basis of all
                the religions of the world.  As a matter of fact, the eternal principles of Vedanta
                themselves constitute the Universal Religion of all mankind, and the different
                religions of the world are only manifestations of this Universal Religion in
                different places and times.  Furthermore, through his lectures and books and through
                the Vedanta Centres which he founded, Swamiji made the life-giving principles of
                Vedanta available to all people without any distinction of caste, creed or race.<br>
                In this way, through the pioneering efforts of Swami Vivekananda, Vedanta has
                crossed the boundaries of India and has now become the common property of all
                mankind.  The work started by Swamiji is now being carried on by many teachers and
                organizations around the world.</p>
