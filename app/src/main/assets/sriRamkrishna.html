        <p>Sri Ramakrishna was born on <b>18 February 1836</b> in the village of <b>Kamarpukur</b> about sixty
            miles northwest of Kolkata. His parents, <b>Kshudiram Chattopadhyaya</b> and <b>Chandramani Devi</b>,
            were poor but very pious and virtuous. As a child, Ramakrishna (his childhood name was <b>Gadadhar</b>)
            was dearly loved by the villagers. From early days, he was disinclined towards formal education and
            worldly affairs. He was, however, a talented boy, and could sing and paint well. He was
            fond of serving holy men and listening to their discourses. He was also very often found
            to be absorbed in spiritual moods. At the age of six, he experienced the first ecstasy
            while watching a flight of white cranes moving against the background of black clouds.
            This tendency to enter into ecstasy intensified with age. His father’s death when he was
            seven years old served only to deepen his introspection and increase his detachment from the world.</p>
        <p><b>As a Priest at Dakshineswar TempleSri Ramakrishna<br></b>
            When Sri Ramakrishna was sixteen, his brother <b>Ramkumar</b> took him to Kolkata to
            assist him in his priestly profession. In 1855 the Kali Temple at <b>Dakshineswar</b> built by
            <b>Rani Rasmani</b> was consecrated and Ramkumar became the chief priest in that temple.
            When he died a few months later, Ramakrishna was appointed the priest. Ramakrishna
            developed intense devotion to Mother Kali and spent hours in loving adoration of her
            image, forgetting the rituals of priestly duties. His intense longing culminated in the
            vision of Mother Kali as boundless effulgence engulfing everything around him.</p>

        <p><b>Intense Spiritual Practices</b><br>
            Sri Ramakrishna’s God-intoxicated state alarmed his relatives in Kamarpukur and they got
            him married to <b>Saradamani</b>, a girl from the neighbouring village of <b>Jayrambati</b>.
            Unaffected by the marriage, Sri Ramakrishna plunged into even more intense spiritual
            practices. Impelled by a strong inner urge to experience different aspects of God he
            followed, with the help of a series of Gurus, the various paths described in the Hindu
            scriptures, and realized God through each of them. The first teacher to appear at
            Dakshineswar (in 1861) was a remarkable woman known as <b>Bhairavi Brahmani</b> who was
            an advanced spiritual adept, well versed in scriptures. With her help Sri Ramakrishna
            practised various difficult disciplines of the <b>Tantrik path</b>, and attained success
            in all of them. Three years later came a wandering monk by name <b>Totapuri</b>, under
            whose guidance Sri Ramakrishna attained <b>Nirvikalpa Samadhi</b>, the highest spiritual
            experience mentioned in the Hindu scriptures. He remained in that state of non-dual
            existence for six months without the least awareness of even his own body. In this way,
            Sri Ramakrishna relived the entire range of spiritual experiences of more than three
            thousand years of Hindu religion.</p>
        <p><b>Following Other Faiths</b><br>
            With his unquenchable thirst for God, Sri Ramakrishna broke the frontiers of <b>Hinduism</b>,
            glided through the paths of <b>Islam</b> and <b>Christianity</b>, and attained the highest realization
            through each of them in a short span of time. He looked upon <b>Jesus</b> and <b>Buddha</b> as
            incarnations of God, and venerated the ten <b>Sikh Gurus</b>. He expressed the quintessence of
            his twelve-year-long spiritual realizations in a simple dictum: Yato mat, tato path
            <b>“As many faiths, so many paths.”</b> He now habitually lived in an exalted state of
            consciousness in which he saw God in all beings.</p>

        <p><b>Worshipping His Wife</b><br>
            In 1872, his wife Sarada, now nineteen years old, came from the village to meet him. He
            received her cordially, and taught her how to attend to household duties and at the same
            time lead an intensely spiritual life. One night he worshipped her as the Divine Mother
            in his room at the Dakshineswar temple. Although Sarada continued to stay with him, they
            lived immaculately pure lives, and their marital relationship was purely spiritual.
            It should be mentioned here that Sri Ramakrishna had been ordained a Sannyasin (Hindu
            monk), and he observed the basic vows of a monk to perfection. But outwardly he lived
            like a lay man, humble, loving and with childlike simplicity. During Sri Ramakrishna’s
            stay at Dakshineswar, Rani Rasmani first acted as his patron. After her death, her
            son-in-law Mathur Nath Biswas took care of his needs.</p>
        <p><b>Contact with Some Notables</b><br>
            Sri Ramakrishna’s name as an illumined saint began to spread. Mathur once convened an
            assembly of scholars, and they declared him to be not an ordinary human being but the
            Avatar of the Modern Age. In those days the socio-religious movement known as
            <b>Brahmo Samaj</b>, founded by <b>Raja Ram Mohan Roy</b>, was at the height of
            popularity in Bengal. Sri Ramakrishna came into contact with several leaders and members
            of Brahmo Samaj and exerted much influence on them. His teaching on harmony of religions
            attracted people belonging to different denominations, and Dakshineswar became a
            veritable Parliament of Religions.</p>
        <p><b>Coming of the Devotees</b><br>
            As bees swarm around a fully blossomed flower, devotees now started coming to Sri
            Ramakrishna. He divided them into two categories. The first one consisted of
            householders. He taught them how to realize God while living in the world and discharging
            their family duties. The other more important category was a band of educated youths,
            mostly from the middle class families of Bengal, whom he trained to become monks and to
            be the torchbearers of his message to mankind. The foremost among them was <b>Narendranath</b>,
            who years later, as <b>Swami Vivekananda</b>, carried the universal message of Vedanta
            to different parts of the world, revitalized Hinduism, and awakened the soul of India.</p>
        <p><b>The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna</b><br>
            Sri Ramakrishna did not write any book, nor did he deliver public lectures. Instead,
            he chose to speak in a simple language using parables and metaphors by way of
            illustration, drawn from the observation of nature and ordinary things of daily use.
            His conversations were charming and attracted the cultural elite of Bengal. These
            conversations were noted down by his disciple <b>Mahendranath Gupta</b> who published
            them in the form of a book, Sri Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita in Bengali. Its English
            rendering, <b>The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna</b>, was released in 1942; it continues to be
            increasingly popular to this day on account of its universal appeal and relevance.</p>

        <p><b>Last Days</b><br>
            The intensity of his spiritual life and untiring spiritual ministration to the endless
            stream of seekers told on Sri Ramakrishna's health. He developed cancer of the throat
            in 1885. He was shifted to a spacious suburban villa where his young disciples nursed
            him day and night. He instilled in them love for one another, and thus laid the
            foundation for the future monastic brotherhood known as Ramakrishna Math. In the small
            hours of <b>16 August 1886</b> Sri Ramakrishna gave up his physical body, uttering the
            name of the Divine Mother, and passed into Eternity.</p>
