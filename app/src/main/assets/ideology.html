        <b><i>IDEOLOGY of Ramakrishna Math and Mission</i></b>
        <HR COLOR="yellow" WIDTH="100%">
        <img src="./harmony.jpg" alt="RK" align="middle">
        <p>The ideology of Ramakrishna Math and Mission consists of the eternal principles of
            Vedanta as lived and experienced by Sri Ramakrishna and expounded by Swami Vivekananda.
            This ideology has three characteristics: it is modern in the sense that the ancient
            principles of Vedanta have been expressed in the modern idiom; it is universal, that is,
            it is meant for the whole humanity; it is practical in the sense that its principles can
            be applied in day-to-day life to solve the problems of life.  The basic principles of
            this ideology are given below:</p>
        <p><b>1. God realization is the ultimate goal of life :</b><br>One of the important
            discoveries made in ancient India was that the universe arises from and is sustained by
            infinite consciousness called Brahman.  It has both impersonal and personal aspects.
            The personal aspect is known by different names, such as God, Ishvar, Jehovah and so on.
            Realization of this Ultimate Reality is the true goal of life, for that alone can give
            us everlasting fulfilment and peace.</p>
        <p><b>2. Potential divinity of the soul :</b><br>Brahman is immanent in all beings as the
            Atman which is man's true self and source of all happiness.  But owing to ignorance,
            he identifies himself with his body and mind and runs after sense pleasures.  This is
            the cause of all evil and suffering. As ignorance is removed, the Atman manifests itself
            more and more. This manifestation of potential divinity is the essence of true religion.</p>
        <p><b>3. Synthesis of the Yogas :</b><br>The removal of ignorance and manifestation of inner
            divinity leading to God realization are achieved through Yoga.  There are four main
            Yogas: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Jnana Yoga (Yoga of Knowledge)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Bhakti Yoga (Yoga of Devotion)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raja Yoga (Yoga of Meditation)
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karma Yoga (Yoga of Work)<br></b>  Each Yoga is an
                independent means of realizing God.  But since each Yoga involves the cultivation
                of one of the faculties such as reason, feeling or will, a combination of all the
                four Yogas is necessary for the development of a balanced, 'fully functioning'
                personality.  It is this synthesis of Yogas that Swami Vivekananda regarded as
                the ideal of Ramakrishna Math and Mission.  This ideal finds expression in the
                EMBLEM of the twin organizations shown here,  which was designed by Swamiji himself.
                In the emblem the wavy waters represent Karma Yoga; the lotus flower represents
                Bhakti Yoga; the rising sun represents Jnana Yoga; the coiled serpent represents
                Raja Yoga; and the Swan represents the Supreme Self. The meaning of the ensemble is:
                by the combined practice of all the four Yogas the Supreme Self is realized.</p>
        <p><b>4. Morality based on strength :</b><br>According to Swami Vivekananda, weakness is the
            main cause of immorality, evil and suffering in life, and the cause of weakness is
            ignorance about one's true nature as the Atman.  Knowledge of the Atman gives us
            tremendous strength to overcome our weakness and lead a virtuous life.  Everyone is
            endowed with so many potentialities, but owing to fear and weakness, most of these
            potentialities remain unactualized.  When, through knowledge of the Atman, fear and
            weakness are overcome, these potentialities manifest themselves.  Swamiji called this
            process 'man-making education'.</p>
        <p><b>5. Harmony of Religions :</b><br>Although the idea that 'one Reality is known by
            different names' (Vedas) and the idea that 'different spiritual paths lead to the same
            goal' (Gita) are found in the Hindu scriptures and in the teachings of several Hindu
            saints, Sri Ramakrishna was the first person in history to show through direct experience
            the transcendental unity of all religions.  His message implies two kinds of religious
            harmony: harmony within Hinduism and harmony among world religions.<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.  Harmony
                within Hinduism : </b><br>Sri Ramakrishna did not identify himself with any particular
            sect of Hinduism but accepted Hinduism as a whole.  He showed that Dualism, Non‑dualism
            and other schools of Hindu philosophy represent different stages of the integral
            experience of Reality, and that the various Hindu Deities are different aspects of one
            supreme Godhead.  His message has brought about a great deal of harmony among the Hindu
            sects, and Sri Ramakrishna himself has become the symbol of the unity of Hindu religion.<br>
        <img src="./religion.jpg" alt="religion" align="middle"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>b. Harmony among world religions :</b>
        <br>It should be noted that Sri Ramakrishna recognized the differences among religions but
            showed that, in spite of these differences, they lead to the same Ultimate Goal.
            This is the meaning of his famous maxim, Yato mat, tato path, <b>“As many faiths, so many  paths”</b>.
            Apart from this, Swami Vivekananda also held that the religions of the world are
            expressions of one eternal Universal Religion. Since Vedanta contains all the basic
            principles and laws of the spiritual world, Swamiji regarded Vedanta as that eternal
            Universal Religion.  That is to say, Vedanta can serve as the common ground for all religions.</p>
        <p><b>6. Avatarhood of Sri Ramakrishna :</b><br>According to the Hindu religious tradition,
            God incarnates himself as the Avatar in every Age in order to give a new message to
            humanity suited to the needs of each Age.  In the Ramakrishna Movement, Sri Ramakrishna
            is adored as the Avatar of the Modern Age.  What this means is that his life and
            teachings have opened a new way of salvation for humanity.  The uniqueness of Sri
            Ramakrishna's Avatarhood is that it embodies the spiritual consciousness of earlier
            Avatars and prophets, including those who are outside the Hindu fold, and is in harmony
            with all religious traditions.  In all the institutions of the Ramakrishna Order,
            worshipful reverence is shown to all Avatars and the founders of all religions.</p>
        <p><b>7.  A New Philosophy of Work :</b><br>Swami Vivekananda has given a new philosophy of
            work for the modern world.  All work in the Ramakrishna Math and Mission is done
            according to this philosophy of work, which is based on the following principles:<br>
        <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. </b>According to Vedanta, the physical universe is a manifestation of God known as Virat.
            Hence, as Sister Nivedita has stated, there is 'no distinction between the sacred and the
            secular'.  What this statement means is that all work is sacred.  Even menial work such
            as sweeping the floor or mending shoes is to be done with as much attention and devotion
            as work in the shrine.<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. </b>The Gita (18.46 & 9.24) states that the all-pervading
            God is the ultimate source of all work and the enjoyer of the fruits of all sacrifice.
            Hence all work is to be done as worship and the fruits of actions are to be offered to
            the Lord.<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. </b>One of the important principles Swami Vivekananda learned from his
            Master was Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva, 'to serve Jiva as Shiva'.  Since man is potentially
            Divine, service to man is indeed service to God.  Instead of looking upon a needy person
            as an object of pity, he is looked upon as an object of worship.  Such an attitude
            elevates both the giver and the recipient.<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. </b>Swami Vivekananda was the first
            religious leader in India to speak for the poor and the downtrodden and to state boldly,
            'He who sees Shiva in the poor, in the weak and the diseased, really worships Shiva;
            and … with him Shiva is more pleased than with the man who sees Him only in temples.'
            It was Swamiji who coined the word daridra-narayana to refer to the poor.  Swamiji's
            love and concern for the poor continues as a directive principle in Ramakrishna
            Mission's service programmes.<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. </b>When work, any work, is done fulfilling the
            above conditions, it becomes a spiritual discipline: the mind gets purified and the
            potential Divinity of the soul manifests itself more and more.  Thus work done as
            worshipful service benefits the doer himself spiritually: it becomes a spiritual
            discipline or Yoga.  It is with this understanding of work as a spiritual discipline
            (Karma Yoga) that all the service activities of the Ramakrishna Mission, such as giving
            food and clothing to the poor, nursing the sick etc, are undertaken.  Thus service done
            as worship of God in man helps in two ways: it helps physically or mentally the person
            who is served, and it helps spiritually the person who serves.</p>
        <p><b><u>M o t t o :</u></b><br>This two-fold aim of service activities, indeed the whole ideology
            of Ramakrishna Math and Mission, has been put in a nutshell in the MOTTO of the
            Ramakrishna Math and Mission,<br><b><i>Atmano mokshartham jagat hitaya cha,<br>'For one's
                own salvation and for the welfare of the world',</i></b><br>formulated by Swami Vivekananda.</p>
